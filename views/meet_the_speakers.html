                  Born at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, Zoha Bharwani was a free-spirited brown baby born to two loving parents, Samina and Sulaiman Bharwani. Their stay in Little Rhody, however, was short-lived, and over the course of her 16 year-life, Zoha has lived in 11 cities and 4 countries. Despite moving around her whole life, she's maintained her love for theater, music, nature and giving back to the communities around her.  In her free time she enjoys spending time with family and friends, reading mystery novels and writing songs. Someday she hopes to have a career in International Development to help ensure that everyone has the opportunities she's been so fortunate to have.

                  Taylor Stark is very excited to be a part of the first ever KUBE event. Since before she can remember public speaking has been a love of hers, usually seen in the form of acting and forensicating but now she is grateful to have the opportunity to show a different side of her performing capabilities. Her best friend is her younger brother, Trevor, and she loves chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and salt and vinegar chips. Her favorite word is cathartic and she is a Pisces. Yes, folks, she would be happy to sign autographs so don't hesitate to ask. When she is not throwing her heart onto the stage she hopes to satisfy her craving to travel the world. Just as she finds inspiration in the little things, she hopes the audience finds something compelling in her speech and she can't wait to present!

I cannot wait to share my theory regarding the Art of Failure at the KUBE conference on February 6th 2015.

                  Brian Hwang is a senior at the International Academy who, as a child, had always dreamed of becoming a superhero. Today, however, he is an inspiring neurologist, hoping of one day eliminating the effects of dementia. While his favorite classes are chemistry and biology, his love for science goes beyond the traditional definition constricted within these subjects. Rather, he defines science as small, seemingly insignificant objects, coming together to create the world we live in. Finding applications of science in his every day life, Brian continues to observe the beauty within the scientific world.

                 I was born and raised for most of my life in Southeastern Michigan. But at the age of five, my mom had taken a job in China, and my whole family had to leave behind the cold but familiar suburbia, to live in Shanghai: China's largest city, with a culture so intriguing to my young mind. It is there where my perception and thoughts of the world were truly first impacted and developed, and still affect me today. However, after three wonderful years living in a fantastic city, we alas had to return to Michigan. Coming home was hard, especially considering the fact that I was just entering the fourth grade, a time notoriously known for children being brutal to outsiders. It is there where I had to find comfort and joy, not in playing with friends, but in learning about the obscure (but interesting) aspects of our world, and this is what I credit to my fondness of vexillology. I had contained these things within myself until I attended the IA, where I felt I was finally able to discuss, enjoy and, of course, learn more about the wonderfully weird things in life with people who appreciated them as much as me with my same enthusiasm. I love quirky things, and I love sharing it with others, so long as they are willing to listen.
